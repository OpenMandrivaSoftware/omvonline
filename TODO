Things to do on mdkonline
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * mdkapplet:
   several releases of the same package may be installed along each other
   (seen for libaspell15, ~december); check that at least the most up to
   date available package is installed.
   Should it be handled by rpm instead?

 * mdkonline, mdkupdate:
   add animated fluffy tux for waiting during computations?

 * mdkapplet:
   a launch system menu item should appear in System > ?

 * mdkapplet:
   should appear only for notification (no config, config problem, available
   updates), not when everything is fine?

 * mdkapplet:
   applet popup display the number of available updates (requires full diff
   check, changes silentCheck() )

 * mdkupdate:
   at start, first query the server to check if anything should be done;
   if nothing, don't run urpmi, just upload the config.

 * mdkupdate:
   should exit, if another mdkupdate is running, or if the urpmi db is locked.

 * mdkupdate:
   started every 2 hours +/- salt ?



 * for pro version (v2)
   changer server/client protocol:
     - move to SOAP or REST,
     - client queries server for higher-level tasks (from a predefined list)
       (package update, install, uninstall, config setting, data processing)
